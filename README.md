# Neuroepithelial-Organoid-Analysis-Pipeline
Overview
This project provides a robust image analysis pipeline to quantitatively distinguish between apical-out and apical-in configurations in neuroepithelial organoids based on fluorescence imaging of ZO1-EGFP or other tight junction markers. It is designed to automate and standardize the analysis of tight junction marker distributions, enabling researchers to extract quantitative data about organoid configurations efficiently. 

Features

Radial Intensity Analysis: Classifies ZO1-EGFP regions as apical-out or apical-in based on their radial distribution.

Quantification: Calculates the percentage of cells with apical-out and apical-in configurations.

Batch Processing: Supports analyzing multiple images in a single run.

Visualization:

Annotated images with color-coded regions (apical-out vs. apical-in).

Graphs showing radial intensity distributions.

Summary statistics exported as CSV.

Extensibility: Supports customization for other tight junction markers or configurations.
