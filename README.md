# Neuroepithelial-Organoid-Analysis-Pipeline
Overview
This project provides a robust image analysis pipeline to quantitatively distinguish between apical-out and apical-in configurations in neuroepithelial organoids based on fluorescence imaging of ZO1-EGFP or other tight junction markers. It is designed to automate and standardize the analysis of tight junction marker distributions, enabling researchers to extract quantitative data about organoid configurations efficiently.
