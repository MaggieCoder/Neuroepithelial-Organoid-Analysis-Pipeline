# Bioinformatics Project - Cell Classification

This project is part of the Bioinformatics 576 Homework 1. It classifies cells into apical-in or apical-out based on their properties.

## Project Structure

- `image_processing.py`: Handles image loading and preprocessing
- `segmentation.py`: Performs segmentation and labeling
- `classification.py`: Classifies cells into apical-in/apical-out
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for saving files and computing stats
- `main.py`: The main script to run everything
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies
- `README.md`: Documentation
- `cell_classification_results.csv`: Output file
- `cell_classification_overlay.tif`: Output image

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
