# Neuroepithelial-Organoid-Analysis-Pipeline

Overview
This project provides a robust image analysis pipeline to quantitatively distinguish between apical-out and apical-in configurations in neuroepithelial organoids based on fluorescence imaging of ZO1-EGFP or other tight junction markers.

Features
- Radial Intensity Analysis: Classifies ZO1-EGFP regions as apical-out or apical-in based on their radial distribution.
- Quantification: Calculates the percentage of cells with apical-out and apical-in configurations.
- Batch Processing: Supports analyzing multiple images in a single run.
- Visualization:
  - Annotated images with color-coded regions (apical-out vs. apical-in).
  - Graphs showing radial intensity distributions.
  - Summary statistics exported as CSV.
- Extensibility: Supports customization for other tight junction markers or configurations.

### **1. Biological Question** üß¨
The project aims to answer:
- What is the spatial configuration of neuroepithelial organoids based on apical polarity?
- Specifically, what proportion of cells exhibit apical-out vs. apical-in configurations, as defined by the localization of ZO1-EGFP, a tight junction marker?
- How does the apical configuration vary under different experimental conditions? For example, conditions such as extracellular matrix (ECM) composition, growth factors, or genetic manipulations.

This analysis will provide insights into the structural organization and polarity of organoids, contributing to our understanding of tissue architecture and its role in organoid function and development.
